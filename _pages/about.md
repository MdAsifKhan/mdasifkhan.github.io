I am a final-year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/"> Bayesian and Neural Systems</a> research group, advised by <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/">Prof. Amos Storkey</a> and <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/">Prof. Chris Williams</a>. I do research in machine learning and artificial intelligence. My PhD work focuses on ML algorithms that account for the structure in data with applications to disentanglement and robustness. The topics that particularly interest me include the following:

* Deep generative models
* Self-supervised learning 
* Bayesian inference
* Equivariant networks and geometric deep learning

Previously, I completed MSc. in Computer Science at the University of Bonn, where I was a research assistant in the Smart Data Analytics (SDA) group. I worked on Machine Learning for Knowledge Graphs with <a href="https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ffm/Lehrstuehle/Machine_Learning/index.html.en">Prof. Asja Fischer</a> and <a href="http://jens-lehmann.org/">Prof. Jens Lehmann</a>. In my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6kGzdH0T11-NVFDNENUZ0g5M3JkOEozdzZzRTh0ZUVOejkw">master thesis</a>, I developed a GAN framework for speech-to-speech synthesis advised by <a href="https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ffm/Lehrstuehle/Machine_Learning/index.html.en">Prof. Asja Fischer</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabiencardinaux">Dr. Fabien Cardinaux</a>. I like to work on problems with practical impact. In several of my projects, I developed ML algorithms for challenging projects such as protein design. For details, please refer to the publications.
