I am a third-year PhD student at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh. I am a member of the <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/"> Bayesian and Neural Systems</a> group, advised by <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/">Prof. Amos Storkey</a> and <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/">Prof. Chris Williams</a>. My research interests are:

* Deep Generative Models
* Representation Learning 
* Bayesian Inference
* Physics-prior in Neural Networks

Previously, I completed MSc. in Computer Science at the University of Bonn, where I was a research assistant at the Smart Data Analytics (SDA) group. I worked on Machine Learning for Knowledge Graphs with <a href="https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ffm/Lehrstuehle/Machine_Learning/index.html.en">Prof. Asja Fischer</a> and <a href="http://jens-lehmann.org/">Prof. Jens Lehmann</a>. In my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6kGzdH0T11-NVFDNENUZ0g5M3JkOEozdzZzRTh0ZUVOejkw">master thesis</a>, I developed a GAN framework for speech-to-speech synthesis advised by <a href="https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ffm/Lehrstuehle/Machine_Learning/index.html.en">Prof. Asja Fischer</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabiencardinaux">Dr. Fabien Cardinaux</a>.
