I am a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School in <a href="https://www.sanderlab.org/#/people/chrissander">Prof. Chris Sander's</a> Lab. My research focuses on machine learning methodologies for cancer risk prediction and combination therapy, with a particular emphasis on interpretable approaches that can guide clinical decision-making. 

For cancer risk prediction, I develop deep learning models using large-scale longitudinal electronic health records. This involves two main components:

* Representation Learning: Encoding patient histories into continuous feature representations with key properties such as disentangled risk factors, interpretability of encoded representation, and mitigating population-specific biases.

* Risk Prediction: Discrete-time event models for cancer risk, with particular emphasis on modelling uncertainties to ensure robust performance and generalisation across diverse patient populations, including out-of-distribution scenarios.

In combination therapy, the goal is to develop computational models of cell biology that accurately capture cellular behaviours and underlying biological processes. To this end, I use machine learning to learn differential equation models that can predict molecular responses to new drug combinations. These models are used for designing effective combinatorial therapies and optimising experimental design.

I have a PhD from the University of Edinburgh, advised by <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/">Prof. Amos Storkey</a> in the <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/"> Bayesian and Neural Systems </a> research group. My doctoral research was at the intersection of geometry and deep representation learning. Please look at my publications for further insights into my work and research.
