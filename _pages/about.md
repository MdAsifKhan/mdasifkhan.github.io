I am joining as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School, where I will be part of <a href="https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/chris-sander-phd/">Prof. Chris Sander's Lab</a>. My research endeavours will focus on machine learning and AI algorithms applied to computational biology. Particularly:

* Multimodal data integration using deep learning for cancer risk prediction.
* Representation learning for single-cell perturbation data.

I have a PhD from the University of Edinburgh, advised by <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/">Prof. Amos Storkey</a> in the <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/"> Bayesian and Neural Systems </a> research group. My doctoral research was at the intersection of geometry and representation learning. I developed deep representation learning approaches to model structures within complex data spaces resulting from invariants. The machine learning topics that captivate my curiosity:

* Deep representation learning and generative modelling.
* Equivariant neural networks.
* Geometric and topological deep learning.

I completed my MSc. in Computer Science at the University of Bonn, where I worked on Machine Learning for Knowledge Graphs with <a href="https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ffm/Lehrstuehle/Machine_Learning/index.html.en">Prof. Asja Fischer</a> and <a href="http://jens-lehmann.org/">Prof. Jens Lehmann</a>. For further insights into my work and research, please look at my publications.
