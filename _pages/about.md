I am a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School in <a href="https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/chris-sander-phd/">Prof. Chris Sander's</a> Lab. My research focuses on developing machine learning and AI algorithms to advance cancer therapy. The emphasis of my work lies on interpretable approaches that can guide clinical decision-making. I am currently working on:

* Incorporating feature selection and uncertainty quantification techniques in deep sequential models to predict cancer risk with greater precision and reliability over time.
* Machine learning approaches to analyse spatial omics data of triple-negative breast cancer to predict the response of patients to chemotherapy.

I have a PhD from the University of Edinburgh, advised by <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/">Prof. Amos Storkey</a> in the <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/"> Bayesian and Neural Systems </a> research group. My doctoral research was at the intersection of geometry and deep representation learning. The machine learning topics that are of particular interest to me:

* Deep representation learning and generative modelling.
* Equivariant neural networks.
* Geometric and topological deep learning.

# I completed my MSc. in Computer Science at the University of Bonn, where I worked on Machine Learning for Knowledge Graphs with <a href="https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ffm/Lehrstuehle/Machine_Learning/index.html.en">Prof. Asja Fischer</a> and <a href="http://jens-lehmann.org/">Prof. Jens Lehmann</a>. Please look at my publications for further insights into my work and research.
